This modpack is all about making the grind to start building, much less. With this modpack you can spend less time missing and more time placing blocks. With the use of ProjectE you can spend more time playing with all the amazing building mods provided in this modpack! I hope you have just as much fun playing this modpack as I am!

This pack is still in its BETA stage as things get fully tested.

### Note:
If you dont want to use ProjectE you can Disable the mod and it shouldnt affect gameplay and progression one bit.
